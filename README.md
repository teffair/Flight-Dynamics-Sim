# Aircraft Longitudinal Dynamics Simulation

## Project Overview

This MATLAB project simulates the longitudinal flight dynamics of a Cessna 152 in a power-off glide. The simulation uses non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the aircraft's trajectory, focusing on velocity, flight path angle, altitude, and range.

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Clone this repository and ensure all files are in the same directory.
2. Run `lab3_script.m` in MATLAB.
3. Generated figures will appear in the MATLAB workspace and can be saved if needed.
 
---

## Files Included

1. **lab3_function.m**: Implements the ODEs governing longitudinal dynamics in state variable form.
2. **lab3_function_trim.m**: This function calculates the trimmed flight conditions for steady, level flight. It determines the trim airspeed (ùëâtrim) and trim angle of attack (ùõºtrim), which serve as the starting point for simulations. These are important for establishing the baseline conditions used to analyze dynamic responses to perturbations.

3. **lab3_script.m**: This script executes the simulation by solving the non-linear ODEs for longitudinal dynamics under different flight conditions. It:

- Initializes the state variables from trim conditions.
- Runs the simulation for scenarios like constant glide angle and varying initial airspeeds.
- Generates plots of velocity, flight path angle, altitude, and range time histories.

### Governing ODEs

The simulation is governed by the following ODEs:

1. Velocity Equation:

2. Flight Path Angle Equation:

3. Horizontal Position Equation:

4. Vertical Position (Altitude) Equation:

Where:
- \(V\): Velocity (m/s)
- \(\gamma\): Flight path angle (rad)
- \(x\): Horizontal position (m)
- \(y\): Altitude (m)
- \(C_L, C_D\): Coefficients of lift and drag
- \(\rho\): Air density (kg/m¬≥)
- \(S\): Wing area (m¬≤)
- \(m\): Aircraft mass (kg)
- \(g\): Gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s¬≤)

#### Lift Curve Slope

The lift curve slope for an untapered rectangular wing of finite aspect ratio can be approximated based on an elliptical loading distribution as:

## Simulation Scenarios

The simulation computes glide profiles for the following conditions:

1. **Constant angle glide at \( L/D_{max} \):**
   - Assumes the maximum lift to drag ratio for minimum descent angle.

2. **Glide from horizontal trim position:**
   - Starts with trim velocity and angle.

3. **Glide from horizontal trim position at trim airspeed +25%:**
   - Initial velocity is 25% higher than the trim speed.

4. **Glide from horizontal trim position at trim airspeed +50%:**
   - Initial velocity is 50% higher than the trim speed.
